        content: 'This lipstick surprised me. Looking at the color in the tube I thought it would be my least favorite of the semi-mattes. Turns out, it ended up being my favorite! In the tube it looked like it would be dryer than the other lipsticks and that it would transfer as a flat purple on my lips. Boy, was I wrong. This lipstick went on just as smoothly as the other two. The difference however was the other lipsticks seemed to remain true to their color in the tube when applied to the lips. Thankfully, in this case, the color transferred differently than what I was looking at in the tube. Once applied, it was a deep purplish pink color with hints of burgundy. It is the best deep berry color I have come across on the market. I will be using this on a regular basis (wearing it now actually!). I had to touch this lipstick up twice during the day and it was only after eating meals. It doesnt seem to fade very much on its own without something physically pulling it off. Love, love, love this color!  This color is a mix of brown and pink. It offers nude look for those that still like to use lipstick but arent all about the flare. I think this color would go great on people with fair and medium skin tones. The darker your skin is the less I think this color would work for you. I noticed on me that the color was just a little to close to my normal skin tone to look natural. For someone like me with darker skin I would suggest using this color to help tone down brighter lipsticks. I used this with one of my hot pick lipsticks and I loved the results. The texture is creamy and the color on the lip is true to the color in the tube. The lipstick had long lasting staying power and did not need much touching up.',
